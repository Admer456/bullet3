# bullet3-adm

A lightweight fork of Bullet Physics SDK for my projects, so it can be used as a Git submodule, in similar vein as [PhysX-lite](https://github.com/Admer456/PhysX-lite).  

Removed:
- data
- examples with great filesize
- most docs
- build3 folder
- tests

The repository filesize is approximately 12 MB, compared to upstream's 130 MB.  
If you decide to clone this, make sure you use `--depth=1`.

Here is the [original, up-to-date Bullet Physics SDK](https://github.com/bulletphysics/bullet3).
